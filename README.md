This installer installs Azure IoT Edge on a local computer for both Windows 10 (supporting both a desktop app or a console app)
as well as Linux (currently Ubuntu is supported only) in a simple, step-by-step manner. It installs all prerequisits and optionally installs
the Azure Industrial IoT Edge modules OPC Twin (see https://github.com/Azure/azure-iiot-opc-twin-module) and OPC Publisher
(see https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-opc-publisher). It also enumerates all IoT Hubs the user has access to for easy selection
of an IoT Hub to associate with the IoT Edge instance.

Releases including a 1-click installer for Windows can be found in the Releases folder.
